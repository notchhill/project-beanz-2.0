The code standards we have decided to use for our project are the CSCI 265 Code Standards.
Link: http://csci.viu.ca/~wesselsd/courses/csci265/standards.html

These standards have been relayed to each team member through our discord, so they all know which code standards are expected.

To ensure each team member complies with these code standards, we have implemented the following procedure: Every time someone makes a new commit, their edits/newly created files will be reviewed by another team member to ensure they are complying with the CSCI 265 Code Standards.
