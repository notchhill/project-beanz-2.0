With a shimmer in its eyes, Lumos responded kindly to my request for assistance.

The physical limitations of Lumos in this realm became apparent, and I realized that, while it held great knowledge and wisdom, there were certain tasks beyond its ethereal capabilities. Grateful for Lumos's honesty, I pondered how I might devise a solution to retrieve the bean and continue my quest within the enigmatic castle.

Lumos, in a soft and measured tone, began to share details about the giant who resided in the castle. It described the giant as a formidable but generally benign figure, one who went about daily routines and chores, occasionally exploring the vast chambers of the castle. Lumos mentioned that the giant's presence had shaped the enchantments of the castle, as the magic was often a reflection of the giant's moods and emotions. Although the giant was not typically hostile, Lumos advised me to be cautious and inconspicuous when exploring, as the sheer size and unpredictability of the giant meant that its actions could inadvertently pose a threat. Armed with this newfound knowledge, I pondered my next steps in the giant's domain, aware of the delicate balance that existed between the ordinary and the extraordinary.

As I began to explore the kitchen of the giant's castle, my eyes were drawn to a surreal tableau of everyday objects, magnified by the grandeur of the surroundings. There stood a colossal chair, its intricately carved details towering above me, a testament to the scale of the giant who resided here. A mammoth broom leaned against the wall, nearly as tall as I was, and a gargantuan garbage can stood in the corner, its lid propped open, revealing remnants of giant-sized feasts. Finally, a massive refrigerator hummed quietly, its imposing presence holding secrets of unknown delicacies hidden within. The kitchen, once an ordinary room, had now become a realm of giant proportions, and I couldn't help but marvel at the fascinating, albeit surreal, world I had entered.

The giant's unpredictable habits meant that the castle could sometimes be a realm of surprising contrasts, where moments of chaos mingled with the enchantment. With this insight in mind, I pondered whether to continue my exploration, aware that each corner of the castle held both secrets and potential challenges.

Will you take on the archer, hoping to outmaneuver their arrows in the grandeur of the throne room, or challenge the wizard in a test of wits and bravery amidst the opulence of the regal chamber? Your choice determines your path in this unexpected battle.

You find yourself standing at the entrance of an underground labyrinth of glass tunnels. A vast expanse of rock and sand has been excavated to accommodate an intricate network of transparent glass pipes, crisscrossing in all directions. The intricate mesh of tunnels appears to stretch endlessly, and their combined faintly blue hue dominates your vision. The light plodding of your feet sends soft echoes throughout the glass corridors. It is eerily silent. Speckled amongst the tunnels, you notice glass rooms where several tunnels converge to meet, mumch like the one you're in now. From where you're standing, you see only one path forward. Also, what appears to be a logbook rests on a nearby glass table. Perhaps it contains useful information?

For some reason, our leaders have diverted their attention to this bean, and even wish to display it within the Glass Tunnel Network! I believe it would clash with the beauty of these tunnels. I can't say I trust a magic bean from far away lands.

The display case doesn't look secured; you should be able to lift it up and grab the bean! There is also a logbook on the floor.

Anyway, on another note, many of my best glassworkers have stopped working as productively as they used to. I'm not sure why. I think they've been distracted by the bean... for some reason. I really wish they hadn't put it down here with us. I'm just... I'm just not sure what things are coming to right now. For the first time in my life, I feel pessimistic about the future. I'm finding it impossible to see the beauty I once saw in these Glass Tunnels.

After a frantic sprint through the glass tunnels, desperately trying to veer in a direction towards the entrance, you encounter your first obstacle. In front of you is a room with uneven mounds of shattered glass piled up on the floor, while more shards come raining in through a large crack in the roof. However, you see a way forward on the other side of the room! If you could just make it through this room...

By some miracle, you emerge on the other side, but to your horror, yet another obstacle blocks your path! A large chunk of the tunnel ahead was totally destroyed! You can still see the other end, but it's so far away! The only conceivable way to proceed would be to...

You back up as much as the narrow space allows, and take a few deep breaths. It's now or never. You sprint as fast as you can towards the tunnel's precipice, praying you don't accidentally slip off before you can even attempt the jump. Your left foot lands one step before the edge, and you know you have to jump on the next. You hold your breath and lock your eyes to the far end of the tunnel as you propel yourself above the abyss. Suspended in mid-air, the distance across the chasm narrows with each passing moment, and in the final heartbeats, you realize you've achieved just enough height to clear the gap! Landing on the very brink, you waver momentarily, then regain your balance, and exhale a sigh of profound relief.

At this point, you should be close to the way you came in, but to your disbelief, you find yourself at a dead end! You freeze -- this can't be happening! -- Panic surges through your veins as you frantically look around but there are no exits other than the way back! Is it over? Are you doomed to be buried in glass, never to be found again? Have you failed to bring the magic beans back to your people?

In a state of total mania, you bolt directly into the glass wall in front of you in hopes of something, anything. But nothing happens. The glass recoils with a subtle quiver as you fall backwards and let out a cry. You crawl towards the wall and slam your fists into it, begging for it to let you past. And, to your surprise, a hairline crack began to snake across its surface. With renewed hope, you stand up, and begin hurtling yourself against the wall as the cacophony of shattering glass grows louder and louder behind you -- just a few more tries... you think to yourself. You ram into the wall again and again, but the sound of collapsing glass grows closer and closer. Panic starts to swell in your mind once more. You start flailing yourself against the wall, but it remains impervious to your attempts to breach it. The cave-in gets louder, until it sounds like it's practically right behind you! With one final, all-or-nothing attempt, and with adrenaline coursing through your body, you throw yourself into the wall.


DD05200













DD05200
Is the crisp shattering of glass you hear the cave-in finally catching up to you? No, it was you, FINALLY smashing right through the wall in your way! You're sent plummeting out of the hole and into the void. Everything whips past you in a blur, except a glass block below you, which only seems to be getting closer and closer. It seems like you're going to fall on top of it. But instead, you break right through the ceiling, and collapse to the floor.

You actually made it back to the entrance of the Glass Tunnels! You are overcome with elation, and can't help but dance fervently to celebrate your victory. But now is not the time to dwindle; you exit the Glass Tunnels for good, and begin the journey back home. Back to Beancouver.
